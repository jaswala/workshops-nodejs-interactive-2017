# TODO

1. time the workshop and adjust timings based on prior workshop data

2. Store survey responses

   - Use Google sheet API
   - assign unique client ids (use localstorage; thus able to continue correct q&a assignment after refresh)
   - record survey answer timestamp => help disambiguate a user's answer (e.g., if they change their answer and we receive results out-of-order)
   - save how-to link (create separate write-up)

3. Anscombe's quartet dataset

   - Add as part of the plotting lab?
