# TODO

1. time the workshop and adjust timings based on prior workshop data

2. Store survey responses

   - save how-to link (create separate write-up; http://railsrescue.com/blog/2015-05-28-step-by-step-setup-to-send-form-data-to-google-sheets/)

3. an indicator (perhaps a dot in the lower left corner) which turns a color based on survey responses

   - useful to help facilitators identify those who may be struggling and/or need a bit more attention

4. plot REPL help text!!!

5. loading animation (spinner, etc)

6. Generate new bundles and update src url to ensure most up-to-date REPL bundle

7. Remove CC-BY-SA image

8. Rebuild on-line documentation.

9. Add link(s) to on-line documentation

10. different types of survey components => e.g., plain text entry for feedback
